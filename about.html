    <h2>About this website & me</h2>

    <h2>Who am I?</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>My name is Xinchen Zhang. I'm also comfortable of being addressed as <em>Cyan</em>, which is my unofficial English name.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <p>I'm 19 years old.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <p>I'm pursuing a Computer Science Bachelor Degree @ UCI.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <p>I hate spiders.</p>

    <h2>What is this website?</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>This is my personal website. Here I jot down my past (and seemingly valuable) experience on problems that I came across, any random thoughts that I came up,
                and notes regarding topics that I studied on college.
            </p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <p>
                This website serves as some sort of a "Mind Palace" of mine. 
                What follows are the reasons why I put all these things onto a website rather than just storing them on my hard drive:<br><br>
                1. I want to practice with my website-coding skills.<br>
                2. I can refer back to the solutions whenever I want if I ran into certain problems that I have solved and recorded before.<br>
                3. It would be cool saying "I have a personal website".

    <h2>What does <em>Spinner's End</em> stand for?</h2>

        <li>
            <p>To <em>Harry Potter</em> fans:<br>
                If you get it, there's no need to say more.<br>
                If you don't get it, shame on you.

        <li>
            <p>To others:<br>
                It's just a random name with no meanings. Forget about it.
