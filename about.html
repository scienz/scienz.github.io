        <h2>About this website & me</h2>
        <hr>
        <h3>Who am I?</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>My name is Xinchen Zhang. I'm also comfortable of being addressed as <em>Cyan</em>, which is my unofficial English name.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <p>I'm 19 years old.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <p>I'm pursuing a Computer Science Bachelor Degree @ UCI.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <p>I hate spiders.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>What is this website?</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>This is my personal blog-ish website. I record the solutions of my frequently encountered problems and the things that I consider valuable.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>I'm still reformatting my old blogs since they tend not to fit on this new look that I updated on Winter 2018.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>What does <em>Spinner's End</em> stand for?</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>To <em>Harry Potter</em> fans:<br>
                    If you get it, there's no need to say more.<br>
                    If you don't get it, shame on you.
                </p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <p>To others:<br>
                    It's just a random name with no meanings. Forget it.
                </p>

        <h3>Website History</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Created on a whim on Feburary 2018 and was originally named <em>My Experience</em>. At first
                it was just a bunch of html files resting on my local machine.
                </p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <p>It ran on AWS for a few weeks under the domain spinnersend.net and was later
                    transferred to Github Pages.
                </p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <p>Website layout was slightly updated on Summer 2018. The design was eventually discarded.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <p>The current look was designed on Winter 2018, which was implemented after I learned there's 
                    something called <em>AJAX</em>.
                </p>
            </li>
        </ul>
