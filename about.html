        <h3>Who am I?</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>
                    My name is Xinchen Zhang. I'm also comfortable of being addressed as <em>Cyan</em>, 
                    which is my unofficially recorded English name.
                </p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <p>I'm 20 years old.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <p>
                    I'm double-majoring <em>Computer Science</em> and <em>Informatics </em> 
                    and pusruing a B.S. @ University of California, Irvine.

        <h3>What is this website?</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>
                    This website is my personal blog and a place where I put things that are important but easy to forget.
                    I intentionally left tools like Bootstrap behind in order to practice my CSS & JS skill, and to add a bit
                    more personal flavor.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Building a website using Angular / Flask is convenient and would certainly work very well, but until I
                    finda proper linux server I will stick to static webpages.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    In case you're thinking about the stale color scheme: Clicking on some spot on the home page can
                    <em>Cyan</em> it.
                </p>

        <h3>Website History</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Created on a whim on Feburary 2018 and was originally named <em>My Experience</em>. At first
                it was just a bunch of html files resting on my local machine.
                </p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <p>It ran on AWS for a few weeks under the domain spinnersend.net and was later
                    transferred to Github Pages.
                </p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <p>Website layout was slightly updated on Summer 2018, which however was eventually discarded.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <p>A new "modern-ish" look was designed on Winter 2018, which was implemented after I learned there's 
                    something called <em>AJAX</em>.
                </p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <p>The layout and look was completely redesigned on June 17, 2019 in order for the website to accomodate 
                   more content and to be more professional.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
