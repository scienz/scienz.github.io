        <h3>What happens when a person types <em>www.google.com</em> into the browser and hits Enter?</h3>
        <p>If the computer isn't connected to the Internet:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>To connect to the Internet, the computer need to get its own IP address.
                It would also need the address of the first-hop router and the address of
                the <strong>DNS server</strong>. <strong>DHCP</strong> would be used here.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>DHCP request</strong> is encapsulated in UDP, which is encapsulated in IP, which is
                encapsulated in 802.3 Ethernet.
            </li>
            <li>
                Ethernet frame broadcast on LAN.
            </li>
            <li>
                Ethernet demuxed to IP, IP demuxed to UDP, and UDP demuxed to DHCP.
            </li>
            <li>
                DHCP server formulates <strong>DHCP ACK</strong> containing the client's address,
                the address of the first-hop router and the name and IP address of the local
                DNS server.
            </li>
            <li>
                The frame is encapuslated at DHCP server, which is forwarded through LAN and
                is demuxed at client. The client receives the <strong>DHCP ACK</strong> reply.
            </li>
            <li>
                Client now 1) has IP address 2) knows the name and address of the DNS server
                and 3) knows the IP address of its first-hop router.
                The client is now connected to the Internet.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>If the computer is connected to the Internet:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Before sending the <strong>HTTP request</strong>, we need the IP address of
                <em>www.google.com</em>: <strong>DNS</strong>.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>DNS query</strong> is created, encapsulated in UDP, encapsulated in IP, encapsulated
                in Ethernet. To send frame to the router, we need the MAC address of the
                router interface: ARP.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>ARP query</strong> is broadcast, received by the router, which rerplies with the
                with <strong>ARP reply</strong> giving MAC address of router interface.
            </li>
            <li>Client now knows the MAC address of the first-hop router. Now send the frame
                containing the <strong>DNS query</strong>.
            </li>
            <li>
                DNS server replies to the client with the IP address of <em>www.google.com</em>.
            </li>
            <li>
                To send an <strong>HTTP request</strong>, the client first opens <strong>TCP socket </strong>
                to web server.
            </li>
            <li>TCP connection is established after the <em>3-way handshake</em>.</li>
            <li><strong>HTTP request</strong> is sent into the TCP socket.</li>
            <li>
                IP datagram containing <storng>HTTP request</storng> is routed to <em>www.google.com</em>.
            </li>
            <li>
                Web server responds with <strong>HTTP reply</strong> (containing web page).
            </li>
            <li>IP datagram containing <strong>HTTP reply</strong> is routed back to client</li>
        </ul>
