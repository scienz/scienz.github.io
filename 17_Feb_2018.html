		<h2>The Ultimate Gaming Solution for Dell XPS 9560</h2>

		<h3>The Problem</h3>

		<p>The problem of thermal and power throttling on Dell XPS 15 can lead to severe
		 reduction of CPU frequency. With Intel Turbo Boost, the max Processor Cache
		 Frequency of i7-7700HQ in XPS 15 9560 should reach up tp 3.49GHZ. However, after
		 a short period of gaming, the cache frequency can drop down to the minimun
		 (0.8GHZ), which results in a significant FPS drop.</p>
		 <br>

		<h3>Intel Dynamic Platform and Thermal Framework</h2>

		<p>The easiest way to alleviate the problem is to delete Intel Dynamic Platform and
		 Thermal Framework.<b>Right click "This PC"- Manage- Device Manager</b>. There could
		 be a class called "Intel Dynamic Platform and Thermal Framework", or all of the
		 relating drivers can be found under the class <b>"System devices"</b>. Once found the
		 drivers, <b>ignore</b> all Intel Dynamic Platform and Thermal Framework Generic
		 Participant, right click on the one called <b>"Intel Dynamic Platform and Thermal
		 Framework Manager"</b>, choose <b>"Uninstall device"</b>, check "Delete the driver software
		 for this device", and click <b>Uninstall</b>.

		<p><span class="note">Note: </span>The driver that you just deleted will come back
		 everytime when the computer is restarted. The only way for now is to delete it
		 for each restart, or just simply do not turn off the computer. Additionally,
		 somethimes Windows Update or Dell Assist will see the missing driver as an update
		 and ask you to install it. Just ignore the message.</p>
		<br>

		<h3>Intel Extreme Tuning Utility</h2>

		<p>This is the method for those who don't want to bother messing around with their
		 computers' motherboard, and it is not as effective as the first step and the step
		 coming up. To solve the throtting problem radically, I suggest to skip directly into
		 the <a href="#STEP3">next step</a>.</p>

		<p>Intel Extreme Tuning Utility (Intel XTU) is a software designed to directly interact
		 with CPU. We can adjust CPU Voltage in it, and the adjustments will be applied immediately
		 after we hit the "Apply" button. Therefore, this tool is powerful but dangerous.</p>

		<p>First download XTU from <a href="https://downloadcenter.intel.com/download/24075/Intel-Extreme-Tuning-Utility-Intel-XTU-" target="_blank">here</a>. Follow the instructions to properly install it. After managing open XTU, click <b>"Advanced Tuning"- "Core"</b> . <span class="note">DO NOT CHANGE</span> anything except for <b>"Core Voltage Offset"</b>. You can decrease the CPU Core Voltage in a range between "-0.120 ~ 0" and I suggest no futher less. Adjust the offset into a proper number by checking out your coumputer's performance, and hit
		 "Apply". This move can reduce heating of CPU when gaming and therefore alleviate the
		 problem of throttling.</p>
		 
		<h4>17 June, 2018 Update</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<p>The optimal <b>Core Voltage Offset</b> for XPS 15 9560 is supposed to be -0.120V</p>
			</li>
			
			<li>
				<p>For other optional changes, you can:</p>
				
				<ul>
					<li>
						<p>disable <b>Turbo Booset Short Power Max</b></p>
					</li>
					
					<li>
						<p>set the <b>Turbo Boost Power Max</b> to 56.00W</p>
					</li>
					
					<li>
						<p>set the <b>Turbo Boost Power Time Window</b> to 64.000 Seconds</p>
					</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
		</ul>

		<h3 id="STEP3">Thermal Grease and Thermal Pastes</h2>

		<p>This step is described in detail in <a href="https://www.ultrabookreview.com/14875-fix-throttling-xps-15/" target="_blank"><cite>How To Fix Throttling on the Dell XPS 15 9560</cite></a>. Here are a few notes:</p>

		<ul>
			<li>Use T5 scewdriver to deal with the Torx screws on the bottom panel,
		 and notice there are two other screws under the XPS nameplate.</li>

			<li>The attachment is tight and it's hard to open it for the first time. Just
		 be patient.</li>

			li>When unscrewing the screws on the motherboard, keep them in the original order,
		 otherwise the size may not be right when you try to put them back.</li>

		</ul>
		<br>


		<h3>Throttlestop</h2>

		<p>Throttlestop.exe is a software used to bypass CPU throttling, which turns out to be
		 common in most laptops. While this sounds to be a perfect solution for our throttling
		 problem here, unfortunately regardless of which version of it I choose, this software does
		 not work on my XPS 15 9560. Still, the most effecient way is to use thermal grease
		 and thermal pastes.</p>
		<br>
		
		<h3>Further updates and notes</h2>
		
		<ul>
			<li>
				<p>If you deleted the IDPTF Manager driver and then slept your laptop or did not use it 
				for a while, chances are high that the driver will be installed back. Always check if the driver 
				was there when you feel you are lagging and freezing.</p>
			</li>
			
			<li>
				<p>If the throttle problem has already occurred (caused by the driver you failed to uninstall), 
				simply uninstall the driver won't fix the problem any more. The only choice left is to reboot your system, 
				or, if that doesn't work as well, shut down your system, wait for a while and then turn it on again.</p>
			</li>
			
			<li>
				<p>At the time when you just turn your laptop on and you are about to delete the driver, if you can't find 
				the driver in Computer Management, it's probably because it was listed as "unknown device" in other sections. 
				Do the same methods as the previous note shows.</p>
			</li>
			
			<li>
				<p>Remember to repaste your laptop after a certain amount of time. It is crucial.</p>
			</li>
